<div id="msgcns!DB2DE5E67B922610!185" class="bvMsg"><p><strong>WHAT </strong>is the sense of having a class at 8:15 at night.... this screws up my entire night.  If there is no fighting tonight.... I'm going to go to Commack from now on.  Crazy time period.</p> <p>Got lots of swag from work today...  Me + swag = happy. </p> <p>Sometimes I wonder what the hell is going on.... feel very stagnant today.  I know I'm impatient, but I want more things to be happening... I don't know WHAT exactly... but I want them to occur.  I have to work on getting my mind set on <u>doing</u> things again.  Must start taking an active role in my own life, instead of being a bystander observing life happen <u>to</u> me.</p></div>
