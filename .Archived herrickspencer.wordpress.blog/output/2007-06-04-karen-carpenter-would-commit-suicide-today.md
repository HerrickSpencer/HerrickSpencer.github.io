<div id="msgcns!DB2DE5E67B922610!190" class="bvMsg"><p>If Rainy Days and Mondays ALWAYS get you down... well today sucks for you.  It's raining pretty bad and who wants to go back to work after a nice weekend like this?!   KCarpenter I feel bad for you today... I hope it's sunny where every you were buried. Maybe the rain doesn't bother you at 6ft below.... who knows? Being permanently retired doesn't hurt either, although... the dead thing is a drag.  I guess I'd rather be &quot;On top of the world&quot; instead.... thanks anyway KC!</p> <p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/92/Karen_Carpenter_-_1980.jpg/200px-Karen_Carpenter_-_1980.jpg" align="left" /> Karen's picture compliments of wikipedia (the only free source of info I trust my fellow websters to edit for me)</p></div>
