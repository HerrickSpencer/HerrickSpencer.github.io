It is no secret that I love keyboard shortcuts… I hate having to move my hands away from the keyboard just to do some small movement with the mouse and go back.&#160; DUMB. If you can do it with a keyboard shortcut.. it is so much faster.

The exception is Internet browsing, there is less fast ways to click on links and scroll in items while in IE…&#160; So I’ve been using Bing (and the goog) Maps…&#160; mainly for <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/">GeoCaching (look it up)</a>, I was looking for a way to scroll the map, and found the shortcuts in the help docs for the coordinal movements (N,E,S,W; or Up, Right, Down, Left for you compass challenged folks) and this allows nice ability to scroll around in 2D. However, I was surprised that the docs did not include the zoom level controls.&#160;&#160; After a bit of searching in forums, it turned out there is away to do this using the keyboard. granted, I still use the mouse to get the cursor to go to the search box, and to make the map the actively focused object. Still this is a big step if you are actively scrolling around in the map.

Here’s the shortcuts I’ve learned for maps so far:

<ul>   <li>Scroll east = right arrow</li>    <li>Scroll west = left arrow</li>    <li>Scroll north = right arrow</li>    <li>Scroll south = right arrow</li>    <li>Zoom out = – (minus key)</li>    <li>Zoom out = + (plus key)</li> </ul>

Google only:

<ul>   <li>Jump further east = End</li>    <li>Jump further west = Home</li>    <li>Jump further north = PgUp</li>    <li>Jump further south = PgDn</li> </ul>

Enjoy!
