I have a friend Anna who we used to live near enough that we would get to see her just about every week. She lives in Jersey City, New Jersey now, and we live in Woodinville, Washington—approximately two thousand eight hundred and eight miles away! We miss seeing her and playing with her and hope we get to see her very soon.

Recently, Anna’s class has done a project on a book called “Flat Stanley” by Jeff Brown. In the book, Stanley gets accidentally flattened but not hurt. This allows him to do previously impossible feats, one of which is to mail himself across the country in an envelope! Therefore, my friend Anna’s class decided to make flat versions of themselves to send to friends far away and allow them to have vicarious adventures to report back to the class. To my great honor, Anna chose to send her ‘Flat Anna’ to me to have an adventure here in the Pacific Northwest region.

## Flight to the West Coast

The trip here by car would take 52-1/2 hours non-stop and probably be easier by taking a plane (6 hours)… but you wouldn’t get the views along the way! Beautiful North Dakota!

Nope, you didn’t take a week to drive here—you smartly flew. Bonus points: you got to see some beautiful shots of Mount Rainier! Mt. Rainier is Washington’s highest mountain and the highest mountain by prominence in the continental US (that means from base elevation to peak, it beats all others). It is an active stratovolcano with a summit of 14,411 feet, and many people each year attempt to scale its glacier peak. It was/is also known as Tacoma by the indigenous peoples of the area, and it is how one of our biggest cities got its name.
