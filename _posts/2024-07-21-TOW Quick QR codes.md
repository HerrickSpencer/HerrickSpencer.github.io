I was looking for a free way to make a QR code from this site. I looked at websites offering it for free, but they usually end in a sign up request. Never mind installing an app just to do the once a year task of QR code creation. Then, and I'm surprised I didn't know about this, right in the browser, for free.... is the option to create one from the current page.

*As long as you are using Edge browser (did you know it is also a chrome browser? You can use all your favorite extensions!)*
