I realized this round that really it is the week after infusion, and not even the day of that is the bad days... particularly days 4-8ish of the cycle that are the worst.  So in that frame of mind of it really being a week each round, that I only have 2 weeks of bad days left, with 2 weeks in between.  Not so bad when looking at it from that point of view.

## Day 0 of cycle : injection 

Day started with me sleeping in big bed with kids... like a rock. I didn't even hear them come in. Kids and I woke up while Fiona was working out downstairs and we happily played and joked til she came up and yelled at us to get our lazy butts up. That sure changed the mood... 

I'm sure her mood was not improved by the fact that we forgot to put the ice packs we use to stave off neuropathy into the freezer the night before, so we had luke warm packs to try and save me from nerve damage in my feet and hands.  I opted to bring all the freezer packs we use for lunches and ouchies.  We ended up using them to decent effect.

The port access and blood draw is always the first order of the day, which went find despite me being in very down mood. It improved with the introduction of sugary croissant and tall americano after the appointment. The blood levels are normal as expected, with my platlets lower, but better than one could hope on the 5th treatment of these poisons.

### Corrections about PET vs PSA

There was a great discussion on whether I'd get a new PET scan and what that could tell us... Dr V informed me that I had it all backwards up until now. The PSA is actually a far better indicator that the cancer has been stopped than if we get all sort of false positive from the PET scan. The PSA test checks for nanograms of Prostate Specific Antogens in about 5mL off blood. This means that in the latest test they couldn't even find 0.03 billionths of a gram of PSA in a vial of 5mL of blood. That is a VERY small amount they could not detect.

### Possible admission to a UW cancer trial

Another thing we discussed, and ultimately applied to be considered for was a trial currently going on at the University of Washington to study if the standard of care is as good, worse, or better than a standard of care plus one other treatment. My current standard of care plan for mHSPC (Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer) is ADC (Androgen Deprivation + Chemotherapy), but if in the experimental side of the trial, this would mean that they would also add radiation therapy on to the package to determine if this has an improved life expectancy. The current data suggests that it does.

### Lunch at our new ritual restaurant

We have been going to Kati Vegan Thai just down the road from the hospital in Totem Lake after many of the infusions, and this day was no different. We have a nice chat with the waitress, Kasi, who used to work there full time but is pursuing yoga instructor interests so is only there sporadically. Very delicious food here, if you are a carnivore that loves curry and pad thai... this is really the place to forget that you aren't eating meat.  I suggest the Pumpkin Curry on a cold day, and Red Curry or the Pad Thai any other. The red rice that it comes with is amazing as well. The whole meal/experience really is spectacular.

## Day 1 of cycle

I could not sleep a wink last night... and spent 5 hours binge watching videos on both NodeJS/Express  and basic authentication patterns for a side project instead. This was very fruitful, but left me in a terrible state for the morning. Two cups of coffee later though and I am ready to rock... I'm pretty sure there is a wall heading my way for the end of the day when I'll need to be helping get the kids to bed. 

HB is coughing so I'm likely going to be sleeping in the spare room when he eventually comes into the big bed tonight. Thankfully Fiona had a good idea we've been doing of training them to sleep in their own beds this past 2 weeks, and that has largely seen a lot of success.

They are all out right now at a birthday party for one of HB's classmates, so I've got the quiet place to myself, which is a blessing, but I'm still not sure how to take a nap.  Instead I've been super productive in my blog posts and creating this Auth flow for the other site my brother and I are working on for the family. 

I've had as much liquid as could go down my throat as well as a **very** nice smoothie I created out of Oat milk, banana, Blueberry Yoghurt, and tofu for protein. It turned out really good. I'll likely do more of this as this is a much better 'snack' for me than the lesser choices I've been eating between meals.  I may write a post about the best diets and avoidable foods to keep you as far from cancer as possible.
