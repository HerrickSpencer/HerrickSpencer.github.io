First Baseball game in 25 years! Wow... They haven't changed much since then... still hitting balls with bats. Kind of sounds like a good funniest home video clipâ€”Bob Saget would make some pithy-yet-stupid joke about it.

Watching Wright drive home the last inning runs to win the game against the A's was quite a thrill. I might not actually wait a quarter decade to return. My last game was in Montreal with the Astros vs the A's... so I told my lovely date that if I see another game, it'll have to be with the A's again.

Please note the ironic nerd shirt.
