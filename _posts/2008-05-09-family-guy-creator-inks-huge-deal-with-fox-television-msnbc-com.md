Seth! You rock star! $100M for 4 years of work... damn, that's sport-star green. This deal makes him the best-paid writer in TV.

“I get a lot of pleasure out of making shows,” MacFarlane said. “It’s a bonus to be getting paid well for it, and it’s a double bonus to be getting paid exorbitantly for it.”

I can't wait to see the upcoming 'The Cleveland Show'...
