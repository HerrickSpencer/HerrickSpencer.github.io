**WHAT** is the sense of having a class at 8:15 at night.... this screws up my entire night. If there is no fighting tonight.... I'm going to go to Commack from now on. Crazy time period.

Got lots of swag from work today... Me + swag = happy.

Sometimes I wonder what the hell is going on.... feel very stagnant today. I know I'm impatient, but I want more things to be happening... I don't know WHAT exactly... but I want them to occur. I have to work on getting my mind set on *doing* things again. Must start taking an active role in my own life, instead of being a bystander observing life happen *to* me.
