excerpt: PSA 0.15! Laura and Isaac invade Washington
date: 2024-07-21 14:18 -0700

I was so excited to have Isaac and Laura out to visit/support our family. I actually asked for more time off from work than usual so I could spend time doing things with the three kids and her. We had a great weekend hanging out with the kids. They (Laura/Isaac) took them to the zoo on Sunday while Andy and I worked on spackling the sheet rock of the new kitchen hood.... which I'll never do again. Leave this to professionals.

On Monday prior to injection I took Laura and Isaac (while kids were at school) to Redmond to see the Forza cars at the Turn 10 building and to town center to get them into journaling. (Highly recommended if you don't already journal... it's free therapy.)

- PSA: 0.15! 
- Support: Laura and Isaac for the win!

## Day 0 of cycle : injection day

Laura and Isaac when with me to chemo and we had a great time, despite the occation. There was a moment when IB was on his phone, but other than that we were constantly talking and discussing many various things.  

Laura helped with the icing... and gotta say... my tolerance to cold is changing from the polar bear of the first injection where I didn't even need the mitts and had it directly on skin, to now where I'm cringing the whole time.

We enjoyed a nice lunch at Serious Pie afterwards (though I also recommend the Kati Vegan Thai place next door).  After which we went to Snap-Doodle Toys so I could get a Lego set for HB to repay my debt for him getting himself dressed in the morning and making his bed for the last week. (Rocket Mech Armor from Guardians of the Galaxy) He actually said, "I really like this dad, thank you for getting this for me." Sometimes that kid is a gem. 

The night before we read "The Kissing Hand" a book from his Aunt Laura, about a baby raccoon that is scared to go off to kindergarten. Their mom takes its hand and spreads the fingers then puts a kiss right in the palm, closes the fingers and tells it that now, when it is missing her, it can press that hand to its face to feel her near. 

HB asked me to do this for him then he returned the favor. So, this has now become a thing. The next morning I had to 'refresh' it.  Arya had caught on and also now wants one at night... but she 'eats' her.
## Day 1 of cycle

At night had insomnia, which is a symptom, but partly due to the kids room being 85Â°F. Since I can't co-sleep with the kids due to immunity drop right after injection, Fiona takes them to the 'big bed' and I take one of theirs.  Due to the heat I grabbed the blowup mattress and slept downstairs...there the heartburn decided to cap off the evening.

One note is about 'chemo-brain', which was warned to me by some friends that have done chemo. I have forgotten I've already made breakfast for the kids at least once... and lost my glasses/cup countless time. This later one I may have to admit happened prior.

So today, while they were actually out in the city, I swear I heard them just outside the door talking unintelligibly, but definitely them talking. Yet... not home. 

Previous to this, I've had the odd bitter taste when eating, due to taste bud decimation. But today, I smelt the smell of cigar ashes every time I ate my breakfast. Luckily if cigar ashes tasted like this coffee and Lox bagel, I'd save money on food by hanging out by humidors.
## Day 2 of cycle

Honestly... the visit with IB and Laura has been too much of a blast.... so I have no memory of this day.  Clearly helping to distract me from life.
## Day 3 of cycle

> I'm good at doing less than what people want me to do - Isaac 2024

> Arya is so formal - Isaac 2024

These are two of my favorite quotes from one of the best minds of his generation.
## Day 4 of cycle

My body and brain have teamed up to let me know I have poison inside me. I've dreamed that the neuropathy (numbness in toes/fingers) that is very extreme, and much worse than reality. The other was getting poison ivy from the yard cleaning I'd done the day before.... get it.... *poison ivy* ... my dreams are not that subtle.

This night the effects hit pretty hard. Bones are all aching and energy is very low. Still managed to help clear up dinner, washed up kids, made up the now empty guest room, and did a load of laundry. Oh, and made this blog site from scratch and wrote [the first of the cancer posts]({% post_url 2024-07-13-cancer-its-why-im-poisoning-myself %}). So.... maybe I'm pushing this a bit hard.

## Day 5 of cycle (final shot)

Lots of pain today but still did a lot of work/tasks (relative to the pain of course). Made dinner and banana bread.

## Other things to mention

- I continue my tradition of yardwork on injection day, this time I had Isaac do the lawn mowing while I cut up tree limbs for the trash and did the cutting of cardboard.
- I miss having my nephew here... he's a great source of energy and magnet for the kids.
