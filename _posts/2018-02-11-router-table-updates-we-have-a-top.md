## Ultimate Router Table Top

Finally got around to making the top for my ultimate router table, and it looks fantastic! üéâ

- The top consists of two layers of 3/4‚Äù MDF with a 1/4‚Äù birch ply on top for a nice finish.
- The banding is 3/4‚Äù Oak, mitered at the corners.
- The table insert that holds the router is a high-quality 3/8‚Äù aluminum plate called the [Woodpeckers Precision Woodworking Tools AI690890 Router Mounting Plate](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010KOP78/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1). It has several great features:
  - Different sizes of inner rings
  - A starting pin
  - Gauges on each side
  - Leveling pins for precise alignment with the top

Adding the oak banding was a bit challenging, but it looks really nice. I used a block plane to level it flush with the top.

To cut the inset for the router plate, I used a template also sold by Woodpeckers. I used a 3/4‚Äù Diablo straight template bit with a length of only 3/8‚Äù. Any longer, and it would have been tough to do.

Then I just added the plate, leveled it up, and voil√†!

Next steps are to make the fence and add the miter track.

## Ultimate Router Fence

I've been playing with Autodesk Fusion 360, having fun with components. This is what I want my router table fence to look like when complete. I actually took a sheet of MDF, drew it in a sketch, then 'cut' it into pieces as components. The front will be 1/4 birch ply to give it a nice look, and there's a hole at the back for dust collection. The bottom section of the front will be able to slide open a bit to allow for larger bits, although I didn't draw in the knobs to show this.
