Thought I’d share this experience. Over the last year or so I’ve occationally used Fusion 360 to design a few things. Some for the 3d Printer and some for modeling woodworking projects. Now I wanted to try my hand at making some more detailed drawings with a parts list generated automatically. What you see here is the results of that experience.

I was even able to create pocket holes for the shelves and add screws straight out of McMaster’s website. This allows me to have an accurate accounting for all cut parts and all fasteners I will be using to make this rack. What a fun and useful skill to gain. If you have any questions, let me know in the comments below. Cheers!
