I am building a fancy workbench for woodworking, and needed some sawhorses. I came across a cool design and decided to make a set of my own. They have the benefits:

* Able to fold up
* Hang on the wall
* Hold a massive amount of weight (I put a couple hundred pounds on them no problem.
* Have an easily replaceable top rail if it gets sawn through.
* Can be carried easily without smacking your legs each step.

Hereâ€™s the [shop dog site](https://woodshopdude.com/) where the designs are. My Version:
