When needing to power on/off my Raspberry Pi, I was tired of constantly pulling out and plugging back in the power cord. So I spliced the biggest toggle push switch I could [find at VetCo](https://www.vetco.net/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=114_121_219&products_id=15054) into the power cord

manufacturer: Philmore 

manufacturer part number: 30-10198 SPST Inline Push-Button Floor Switch ON-OFF 1A

Works great!
