<p>Quick and easy tips… for maps:</p> <p><a href="http://my/sites/herricks/TipOfTheWeek/default.aspx"><img title="Tip-of-the-week-TOW" border="0" alt="Tip-of-the-week-TOW" src="http://my/sites/herricks/TipOfTheWeek/Lists/Posts/Attachments/17/Tip-of-the-week-TOW---top_thumb_thum_thumb_60E65273.jpg" width="550" height="167"></a></p> <p>It is no secret that I love keyboard shortcuts… I hate having to move my hands away from the keyboard just to do some small movement with the mouse and go back.&nbsp; DUMB. If you can do it with a keyboard shortcut.. it is so much faster.</p> <p>The exception is Internet browsing, there is less fast ways to click on links and scroll in items while in IE…&nbsp; So I’ve been using Bing (and the goog) Maps…&nbsp; mainly for <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/">GeoCaching (look it up)</a>, I was looking for a way to scroll the map, and found the shortcuts in the help docs for the coordinal movements (N,E,S,W; or Up, Right, Down, Left for you compass challenged folks) and this allows nice ability to scroll around in 2D. However, I was surprised that the docs did not include the zoom level controls.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a bit of searching in forums, it turned out there is away to do this using the keyboard. granted, I still use the mouse to get the cursor to go to the search box, and to make the map the actively focused object. Still this is a big step if you are actively scrolling around in the map.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Here’s the shortcuts I’ve learned for maps so far:</p> <ul> <li>Scroll east = right arrow  <li>Scroll west = left arrow  <li>Scroll north = right arrow  <li>Scroll south = right arrow  <li>Zoom out = – (minus key)  <li>Zoom out = + (plus key)</li></ul> <p>Google only:</p> <ul> <li>Jump further east = End  <li>Jump further west = Home  <li>Jump further north = PgUp  <li>Jump further south = PgDn</li></ul> <p>Enjoy!</p>
