# Please bear with me
I am in the process of moving my [WordPress blog](https://herrickspencer.blog) to this new site.  I am re-learning Jekyll at the same time, and started out with a nice theme called Chirpy (check them out on github).

My About page is WAY out of date, and I will update the info there ASAP. 

The biggest step is converting all the old blog posts from WP to Markdown. I've done this, but have to make a bunch of edits to fix the conversion. As I fix these archive posts, you will see them appear in this site as well. I will likely write a post on this experience as well. 

I will be adding more content soon about what I've been involved with, and new TOWs.

Cheers, Herrick.
