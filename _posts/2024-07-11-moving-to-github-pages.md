## Please bear with me

I am in the process of moving my [WordPress blog](https://herrickspencer.blog) to this new site.  I am re-learning Jekyll at the same time, and started out with a nice theme called Chirpy (check them out on github).

My About page is WAY out of date, and I will update the info there ASAP.

The biggest step is converting all the old blog posts from WP to Markdown. I've done this, but have to make a bunch of edits to fix the conversion. As I fix these archive posts, you will see them appear in this site as well. I will likely write a post on this experience as well.

I will be adding more content soon about what I've been involved with, and new TOWs.


There is nothing inherently wrong with the WordPress system/site, just that I want to have ultimate control over the style and content, without adds.  I'd say because it is free, but there is a lot of effort involved in maintaining your own site, thus WordPress deserves the nominal fee they charge for that service. I have no regrets having been on here for a decade.

Eventually, once I switch over all the domains, you will be able to go to the new pages from all these URLs:

- https://HerrickSpencer.com
- https://HerrickSpencer.blog
- https://GlutenFreeApps.com
- https://SingleMaltCheese.com

Cheers, Herrick.
