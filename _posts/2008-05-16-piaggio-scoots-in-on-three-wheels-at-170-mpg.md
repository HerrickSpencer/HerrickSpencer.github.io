[Piaggio ready to release 170 mpg hybrid two and three wheel scooters](https://www.gizmag.com/go/7730/)

NO Way!! Very cool machine... kind of reminds me of an eco-friendlier puny version of the [Chrysler Tomahawk](https://ohgizmo.com/video-chrysler-tomahawk-v10-production-ready-motorcycle)!

I like the idea that if my front tire decides to self-implode, I have a backup... wonder what it would be like to ride that adrenaline-fueled nightmare to its conclusion? However, I always thought that the smaller wheels on these scooters lead to bad center of gravity issues. Why can’t they make something like this with regular-sized wheels? Give me something that can turn without making me feel like I’m on a weeble-wobble!

Also, speaking of wheels... what the hell is up with those rims!? Did they run out of cash? My old Toyota Corolla has cooler rims than this!

Nice job, Piaggio... just fix those tires and I’ll come pick mine up.
