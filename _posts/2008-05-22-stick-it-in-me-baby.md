<div id="msgcns!DB2DE5E67B922610!237" class="bvMsg"><p><a title="IEEE - &quot;Hands On&quot; by: Amal Graafstra" href="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/print/4940" target="_blank">IEEE - &quot;Hands On&quot; by: Amal Graafstra</a></p> <p>Such a cool thing to do... I think biometric/implantation ID systems hold lots of interesting possibilities of what we can control.  A friend of mine is already turning his Media Center into a voice controlled device that he can access from any room in the house.  I really want to start making some remote accessible robotic devices that can be linked via IP. Items like window openers, fans, lights, all media equipment.. then a centralized system that could be used to access all these items, and recognize when I walk in the door, or respond to my voice. It could be set to ‘know’ my preferred settings for temperature, lighting, music, volume levels, movie/TV preferences…etc.  Similar to the Gates Xanado 2.0 estate, but add biometrics! (If he hasn’t added that yet, he should)</p> <p><img src="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/images/mar07/images/rfid01.jpg" /></p></div>
