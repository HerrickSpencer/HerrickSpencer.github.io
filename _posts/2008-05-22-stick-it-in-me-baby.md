[IEEE - "Hands On" by: Amal Graafstra](https://spectrum.ieee.org/hands-on)

Such a cool thing to do... I think biometric/implantation ID systems hold lots of interesting possibilities of what we can control. A friend of mine is already turning his Media Center into a voice-controlled device that he can access from any room in the house. I really want to start making some remote-accessible robotic devices that can be linked via IP. Items like window openers, fans, lights, all media equipment... then a centralized system that could be used to access all these items, and recognize when I walk in the door or respond to my voice. It could be set to ‘know’ my preferred settings for temperature, lighting, music, volume levels, movie/TV preferences, etc. Similar to the Gates Xanadu 2.0 estate, but add biometrics! (If he hasn’t added that yet, he should)
