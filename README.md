Blog site for hosting previous blog posts, and new thoughts on technology, Software Development, DIY, Woodworking, Tips of the Week, and parenting.

This site was created using the [Chirpy Theme](Docs/Chirpy%20Theme.md),  however I have altered some of the layouts and css to suit my needs. Namely separating posts that I don't want to be on the home page, but still want people to have access to. I plan on changing this to be [an array in the site params](Docs/HomeExclusionList) in the future.

Ongoing or proposed work for the site can be found in the [Site Work](Docs/Site%20Work.md) page.
