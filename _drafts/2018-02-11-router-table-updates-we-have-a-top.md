Finally go around to making the top to my ultimate router table. It looks freakin’ fantastic!

<a href="http://herrickspencer.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/20180128_182923.jpg"><img style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border:0;" title="20180128_182923" src="http://herrickspencer.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/20180128_182923_thumb.jpg" alt="20180128_182923" width="244" height="184" border="0" /></a>

Top is two layers of 3/4” MDF with a 1/4” birch ply on top for a nice look. The banding is 3/4” Oak mitered at the corner. The table insert that holds the router is a very nice 3/8” aluminum beauty <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010KOP78/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">“Woodpeckers Precision Woodworking Tools AI690890 Router Mounting Plate”</a> that has some great features. Several different sizes of inner rings, a nice starting pin, and even a set of gauges on each side. Best part is the leveling pins to make it dead flush with the top.

It was a bit tough to add the oak banding, but it looks really nice. I used a block plane to level it flush with the top (not sure why I didn’t use a flush trim bit on a router?… hey hey hey…neither do I.)

To cut the inset, I used a template also sold by Woodpecker, using a 3/4” Diablo straight template bit with a length of only 3/8”.. any longer and this would have been tough to do.

Then I cut the center out, leaving 3/4” on all sides for the plate to rest on. To do this I used my Roto-Zip with a spiral up cut bit for wood. This took patience because if I went too fast I’d break a bit… which I did, twice.

Then just added the plate, leveled it up.. and voila!

Next steps are to make the fence and add the miter track.

<h2>Ultimate Router Fence</h2>

Playing with Autodesk Fusion 360, and having fun with components... This is what I want my router table fence to look like when complete...I actually took a sheet of MDF and drew it in a sketch, then 'cut' it to pieces into components, then rearranged those components into what you see... just to make sure I have enough material. very cool and fun. Front is going to be 1/4 birch ply to give it a nice look; hole at the back is for dust collection. The bottom section of the front will be able to slide open a bit to allow for larger bits, but I didn't draw in the knobs to show this.
