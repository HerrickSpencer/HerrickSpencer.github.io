I want to thank the whole Snipping Tool team as well as our partner teams in Souhou and Paris for the support and leaning opportunities I have had working on the Inbox Apps team. At the time I joined in April of 2022, I had been working on a very exciting and fun team “App Ninjas” in the Scale and Incubation team under Shen Chauhan. On that team I got to fly around the world to different locations to evangelize the Windows ecosystem to developers and teach new framworks and apis. I was given the challenge to work directly with and solve very difficult blocking issues between Azure or the OS  and unblock 3rd party developers at companies in fortune 500 down to single small app developers. This was very exciting and huge period of technical growth for me and was extremely fun too.
When I was looking for my next challenge and adventure, I saw an opportunity to move to the Snipping Tool app team and fix what I felt was one of the biggest items missing from the Windows system. In my opinion this was the ability to take screen recordings complete with audio. Sure this was able to be done by 3rd party apps, or by hacking together a Xbox Games recording (1 app only) or using PowerPoint to make a slide and screen record. All of these seemed excessively over complicated and non-intuitive for a OS as mature and fluid as Windows 11. Adding a recording option was my main focus for moving to the Snipping Tool team, as well as to assist in the massive backlog of new AI features in the pipeline.



I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the entire Snipping Tool team, as well as our partner teams in Souhou and Paris, for the incredible support and learning opportunities I have experienced while working on the Inbox Apps team thus far.
Reflecting on my journey, I have learned so much from our collaborations. Together, we have successfully shipped countless features and efficiency improvements that enhance the workflow on Windows for our dedicated and faithful users. When I joined, I had little experience in C++, but thanks to your support, I have grown significantly and can now confidently say that I am a resource to others in this language. This valuable skillset is something I deeply appreciate.
One of the most rewarding aspects of the past three years has been influencing the architecture of our app and mentoring many of you. It has been a privilege to advocate for our app and your features. Watching you take parts of our conversations and run with them, creating impactful solutions for the team and advancing individually, has been incredibly fulfilling. I am proud that you saw me as a confidant and resource to bounce your ideas off, and I hope you will continue this in your professional journey. We still have much to share and learn from each other.
A special thank you to Fernando and Stephanie for mentoring me in my role on this team and giving me the space to achieve these goals. I expect that my role in Andrei’s team will benefit from this stewardship as well. I am excited to assist his team in achieving a similar path, learning a new language/framework and the architecture of an unfamiliar, complicated application. This will be an exciting challenge that we can all share in both struggle and glory.
I look forward to our continued partnership and wish my former team the best. My virtual door is always open to you. Thank you!
