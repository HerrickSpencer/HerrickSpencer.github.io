## The 7 Stages of Vibe Coding

Before diving into the [AI Task Flow](/_posts/2025-10-27-AI%20Task%20Flow%20Demonstration%20with%20GitHub%20Copilot.md) from the previous post, let's explore the natural evolution most developers experience when adopting AI-assisted coding. I call this progression "The 7 Stages of Vibe Coding" - a journey from basic copy-paste workflows to sophisticated AI collaboration.

### Stage 1: The Stack Overflow Replacement

#### Web Copilot Copy-Paste Era

You discover web-based AI tools and suddenly realize you can ask questions instead of scrolling through Stack Overflow answers from 2012. You copy-paste responses directly into your code, celebrating the death of the purple link syndrome. It's faster than Stack Overflow, but you're still in glorified copy-paste mode.

### Stage 2: The Prettier Interface

#### AI App Agents with Style

You graduate to dedicated AI apps with nicer UIs - ChatGPT, Claude, or other agents. Same copy-paste workflow, just with better conversation threading and a more polished experience. You feel sophisticated, but you're still essentially doing Stage 1 with better aesthetics.

### Stage 3: The IDE Integration

#### "Do This" Prompting

GitHub Copilot arrives in your IDE! You start using AI directly in Visual Studio or VS Code. However, you're still stuck in "do this" mode - firing off minimal prompts with little context, getting minimal goal-oriented results. It's convenient, but often frustrating when the AI misunderstands your intent.

### Stage 4: The Context Awakening

#### Better Prompting with Purpose

You realize the AI needs context to be truly helpful. It would be like giving an incredibly smart intern a vague task and expecting gold... it isn't going to happen without more details. You start providing better descriptions of what you want, including relevant code snippets, explaining the broader purpose, and setting clearer expectations. Results improve dramatically, but it's still hit-or-miss on complex tasks.

### Stage 4.5: The Project Primer

#### AI-Generated Documentation Bootstrap

You level up by starting conversations with an AI-generated document that describes your overall project, codebase structure, and how to run/test everything. This becomes your conversation initializer, giving the AI a solid foundation to work from. Game-changer for consistency.

### Stage 5: The Planning Phase
#### GHCP: Think Before You Code

You discover the power of asking GitHub Copilot to develop a plan before writing any code. You collaborate on the approach, iterate on the strategy, and only then execute the work. This dramatically reduces the back-and-forth of "that's not what I meant" conversations.

### Stage 6: The AI Task Flow

#### Polished PRD + Structured Execution

Welcome to the methodology [from the AI Task Flow post](/_posts/2025-10-27-AI%20Task%20Flow%20Demonstration%20with%20GitHub%20Copilot.md)! You start with a highly polished Product Requirements Document (PRD), iterate on details, then generate a comprehensive list of grouped and sub-level tasks. Each step allows for user collaboration, resulting in atomic commits and maintainable code changes.

### Stage 7: The Custom Agent

#### No-Sicophancy Evaluation

The ultimate stage involves custom agents that can evaluate all requests without false agreement, ensuring that the planning and task organization of Stage 6 is always performed correctly. These agents push back when needed and maintain high standards for the development process.

Most developers I've talked to are somewhere between Stage 2 and 4. Your goal is to rise up from the depth of Vibe Coding's baser cousins and take an active collaborative role in your AI enhanced skill set. Today you have been promoted to a Dev Manager of AI, not it's annoying boss, but a true coach to make you both shine.  

Enjoy the journey!
