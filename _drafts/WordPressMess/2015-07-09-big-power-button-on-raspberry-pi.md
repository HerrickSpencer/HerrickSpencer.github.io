When needing to power on/off my Raspberry Pi, I was tired of constantly pulling out and plugging back in the power cord. So I spliced the biggest toggle push switch I could <a href="http://www.vetco.net/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=114_121_219&amp;products_id=15054" target="_blank">find at VetCo</a> into the power cord :

manufacturer: Philmore
manufacturer part number: 30-10198
SPST Inline Push-Button Floor Switch ON-OFF 1A

Works great!
