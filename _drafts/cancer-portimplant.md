excerpt: The process of adding a port to inject the chemo...wow.
---
The weirdest thing I've seen, and pretty much the only time I got woozy thinking about it, was when it was explained how they actually planned to inject the chemicals into me. They basically put a little bottle neck inside your chest, and the other end of this is attached to a tube that snakes its way up and over your collar bone and then back down (get ready) into your Superior Vena Cava, named because it is a very large vein leading directly into your heart.

Is this ever going to stop?
