I should really start this one by disclosing a line from my journal the day prior.
> While I meditated today (to the meditation Fiona made using AI) I decided that there was no way I would not be cured. When I look into the future, I see no chance of reoccurance or elongation of this treatment.

I was going to be fine. There was no way this was going to be more than a bump in the road.

- PSA: 0.32!
- Support: Alex!

## Day 0 of cycle : injection
I'd picked up Alex from the Airport the day prior, only an hour after dropping Karen off. A true changing of the guards. Alex is like a toy to the kids, pretty fun to watch them enjoy his brand of silly.

Kids were not awesome getting to school with mom, which put me in a sour mood. Maybe that's a good distraction for the real emotions I was going through, considering putting myself through this hell once again.

Chemo injection and access... easy as last time, maybe easier.  Fiona said, "I have to go to at least one of these things", so she came along for the first bit, but left in the middle of injection so she could work. If that sounds like I'm upset about it, no way, I want her to get as much time working/study as possible. There is precious little time left in our days lately, and watching me drain a IV bag is not a good use of her time.

I had a blast talking to Alex and getting caught up on his life.  We shot the shit for the hour and it flew by, punctuated by the act of changing ice bags on hands and feet every 10 minutes.  Fiona returned to pick us up and we all went out to eat at a lovely vegan Thai place near the hospital. 

I did go out to mow the lawn afterwards though.
