- PSA: 0.03!
- Support: Karen parte deux!
- Approx cost for the year: $130,000

Karen arrived late night Sunday, so I had to retreat to the shared office and abandon the beautiful workstation I'd setup for my support guests. This includes a 49" HDR 1000R Curved monitor... my support staff are living swank.  The kids were having some meltdowns while mom was picking her up... so Karen had to say hello to one of them from time-out! 

Next day was a work day, so she worked on her side business and ignored all tax cheats (kidding, she'd taken the day off). I got to see how she manages her marketing, and posts new social media vids.  My job was struggling with build issues... so I was left in a horrible mood for the next day's adventure.

Side story and possible blog post was the struggles to get my meds for this round was a PITA due to the insurance company forcing us to use their specialty pharmacy to order online. This caused so much backup and wasted time tryiing to get scripts transferred and an arbitrary 5 day processing time, and shipping delays that the meds have arrived on the last possible day, but only because I fought tooth and nail to get this done. One of which we had to even get an exception to get it from the same local pharmacy, because the online one would have had me missing a week of doses.

All this is to say that going into this cycle there was a considerable amount of wasted time, anxiety, and stress due to unnecessary cost savings of my insurance, and some unruly children that live here.

## Day 0 of cycle : injection

The day started quaint enough because I was snuggling with Arya and having a delightful morning, until mom tried to get her ready for school. Then HB was not much better. All sort of fighting and noise occurred trying to get them out the door.  This and other items put me in such a sour mood... I was struggling to get up the emotional energy to get through the day, and predicted I'd be bed-ridden by the afternoon.

Chemo was similar to the rest, except Karen and I played a game of chess, with me calling out my moves and her moving pieces for me, since my hands were wrapped in icy gloves. This led to a nice discussion of chess basic strategies and the concepts of the open/middle/end parts of the game. We had some nice discussions on lots of topics, and a very nice call to mom. One thought we had was to write down a list of the top 10 things to make chemo better/more effective/easier.

The sun came out after the treatment and my mood lifted. We had lunch at a pasta restaurant in Kirkland. Then we went home and I mowed the lawn... as is the tradition in chemo.
