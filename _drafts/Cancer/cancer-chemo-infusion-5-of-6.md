I realized this round that really it is the week after infusion, and not even the day of that is the bad days... particularly days 4-8ish of the cycle that are the worst.  So in that frame of mind of it really being a week each round, that I only have 2 weeks of bad days left, with 2 weeks in between.  Not so bad when looking at it from that point of view.
