<p>At my work (as with many other programming jobs…) When you submit code changes you have to fill out a description with a template that includes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Why this change is needed?</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>What was changed?</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>How was it tested?</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the last question…. since we have been going at break next speed… there has been NO real testing done. So.. everyone is answering "Manually tested" in that area.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However… I got bored of this and got creative (with a little AI help)<br>My latest PRs contained this for "How was it tested?"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With fingers deft and keen,<br>I tried each feature and routine,<br>By hand and eye, I did make sure,<br>No flaw remained obscure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each button and each command,<br>Examined in detail grand,<br>To ensure the software passed,<br>My testing scrutiny, steadfast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus, with methodical delight,<br>I manually tested through the night,<br>And in the morning's light I knew,<br>The program was ready, through and through.</p>
