excerpt: Quick list of tools I value when doing repairs on my bikes, as well as some advice.
---
I was answering a co-worker's question on what tools to buy to get into bike maintenance, and made this very rough list of items that I'll try to keep updated if I think of more.  Start slow, and don't buy everything at once, only as you need them for the current project. Buy quality tools that will last a lifetime, but don't go crazy, some tools really don't need to be from expensive brands.

Note: I like the Park Tools brand, but it is overpriced in some cases, so for some things, just get a cheap alternative.

Note2: I linked to the Amazon items only for easy reference, but please try to utilize your local bike shop when possible so they will be there the next time you are in a pinch. Also there are some great online shops dedicated to bike maintenance and have great advice.  

Note3: As always with DIY YouTube is your friend when learning how to solve a issue new to you.

## Basic bike maintenance

This requires very few tools, most of which you likely have in a toolbox already.

- Spanners or adjustable wrenches (you'll need two when dealing with non-quick release axles)
    
- Basic flat and Phillips screw drivers
    
- Tire levers (I have parktools here, but these are given away for free at bike conferences and some shops.)
    
- Vice grips are nice for holding onto a brake cable when adjusting brakes, or you can get [a speciallized tool](https://a.co/d/fNIsNdU "https://a.co/d/fNIsNdU") for this (though don't spend that much)
    
- Tire pump with both style of valve and a large readable display. I have the [Parktool home mechanic floor pump pfp-6](https://www.parktool.com/en-us/product/home-mechanic-floor-pump-pfp-6 "https://www.parktool.com/en-us/product/home-mechanic-floor-pump-pfp-6") but this has been discontinued. I like it better than the replacement (PFP-8) they have.
    
- A [Bike stand](https://a.co/d/1JPlSBl "https://a.co/d/1JPlSBl") is not a requirement, but boy does this save your back some pains.
    
- Don't bother patching tires... Just buy a new one. (thought keep [a patch kit](https://a.co/d/06wkHiJ "https://a.co/d/06wkHiJ") [](https://a.co/d/06wkHiJ "https://a.co/d/06wkHiJ")in your road kit)
    

## Things you likely won't need till you want to do more complicated improvements/repairs:

- [Chain tool](https://a.co/d/7nj72tr "https://a.co/d/7nj72tr") for both breaking and replacing your chain. I've only done this once or twice, so don't buy till you buy a new chain.
    
- [Headset remover (these you can even make yourself with a piece of tubing)](https://a.co/d/2QZXHRQ "https://a.co/d/2QZXHRQ")
    
- [Headset and bottom bracket press](https://a.co/d/7LXJa2L "https://a.co/d/7LXJa2L") to squarely replace the headset you previously removed. You can even make this too with a threaded rod, nuts and a bunch of large washers.
    
- If you want to replace your rear sprockets you'll need a [Sprocket tool](https://a.co/d/bndt98n "https://a.co/d/bndt98n") with an associated [lock ring tool](https://a.co/d/7mKyj5h "https://a.co/d/7mKyj5h")  that matches your bike (there are 3 or so different types).
    
## For your squeaky cranks:

- To remove your crank arms you'll need a wrench (typically allen) to remove the cover.
    
- Then to actually get the crank arm off, you'll need a crank puller... it really depends on what type of crank you have. There is a few. However this [Park Tool Cwp-7 Crank Puller | Jenson USA](https://www.jensonusa.com/Park-Tool-CWP-7-Crank-Puller-Spline-Or-Square-Taper-Crank-Puller?pt_source=googleads&pt_medium=cpc&pt_campaign=&pt_keyword=&msclkid=062365514ad1158d828e03e0472e8109&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=CP%20%7C%20MF%20%7C%20BNG%20%7C%20SHOP%20%7C%20NBR%20%7C%20All%20Products&utm_term=4585444531556787&utm_content=All%20Products "https://www.jensonusa.com/Park-Tool-CWP-7-Crank-Puller-Spline-Or-Square-Taper-Crank-Puller?pt_source=googleads&pt_medium=cpc&pt_campaign=&pt_keyword=&msclkid=062365514ad1158d828e03e0472e8109&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=CP%20%7C%20MF%20%7C%20BNG%20%7C%20SHOP%20%7C%20NBR%20%7C%20All%20Products&utm_term=4585444531556787&utm_content=All%20Products") covers both of the most common types, so if you have a kids bike as well the smaller end will cover that.  I also like that it doesn't have a lever arm so you can use your standard wrench with an extender.
    
- To grease your crank hub you'll need grease (Can just get this from local shop... any will be ok).

I will go look through my tool chest for more in a few months, and likely update.  If you have any questions on what to use for specific situations, feel free to drop me a line or comment below.
