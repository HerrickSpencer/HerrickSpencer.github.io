Some people who have not experienced the full time care of a small child may view parental or bonding leave as a vacation. Yes, there are many people in your own workplace that still views this benefit as a ‘perk’.  I was not one of them but I, like them, thought it a bit of a bonus where you get to stay home and relax with your new child. (likely influenced by experience babysitting cousins and neighborhood kids) So I had a vast list of goals set out for myself when embarking on my leave, knowing that I likely would not accomplish most of them, but thinking I’d get a vast number completed.

Oh how silly this was looking back.

# Learned to play the violin to a decent degree too!
I bought an electric violin so that while my son slept I could practice... and I learned a great deal, enough to place some classics.

# Completed Watch Dogs 2
I think this game came out just around this time, and I was able to single handedly finish all of the missions, even on the two person ones!
