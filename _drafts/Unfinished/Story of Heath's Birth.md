## Fertilization

Fiona and I (Herrick H. Spencer) wanted a child... ok, so Herrick wanted them, Fiona was nice enough to want them for Herrick. Her quote, "I want to pop them out and hand them to Herrick to raise them" kind of sums it up. She was kidding of course, but there was some truth in the fact that I had a lot of experience with kids (babysitting cousins and neighbor kids helped) and Fiona had very little.
We tried for 2yrs to have one naturally to no success. Finally we went to the fertility specialists and got a checkup. Much to our surprise, we both had excellent test results, both of us hitting super human numbers. Fiona had many good eggs ready and my results, 4x the norm, were a talk among the nurses there (and we hung the report on the fridge for a few days too). :)
So... what was the issue? It turns out that we needed to have some hormone help to stop the womb from kicking out the fertilized egg, basically the hormones would thicken the walls of the womb and give it a nice place to attach and grow.
First though we needed to extract some eggs and fertilize them for reimplantation. We did this once, and it was quite an ordeal for Fiona and a painful process, and got a dozen or more eggs to fertilize. However after some DNA checking for potential issues, none of those eggs were viable candidates for implanting.
So, we entered round two of extraction, getting another batch of eggs and fertilizing them as well. This

## Wishes for DNA

I wanted HB to have mom’s eyesight, she wanted him to have my looks, which made me question giving him her eyesight.
