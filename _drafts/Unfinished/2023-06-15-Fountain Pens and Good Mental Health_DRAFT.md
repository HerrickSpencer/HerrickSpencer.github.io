Fountain pens have saved my life in many ways... and they can help you too.

When I was a kid, I got a basic Scheffler calligraphy set that included a rather simple pen, 4 nib sizes, and a set of four ink cartridges. I used only one of the nibs and two of the cartridges to play around with line weights and make some fancy writing in my drawing pad. Fast forward a bit to my 20's and I started using this set to write in things like Christmas cards and some letters I'd send on special occasions.
