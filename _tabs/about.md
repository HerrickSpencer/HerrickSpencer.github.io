# Herrick Spencer

I'm a Senior Development Engineer at Microsoft on the Windows AI and Inbox Apps team, where I work on the applications that ship with Windows—Calculator, Notepad, Sound Recorder, and Alarms & Clock. I spent three years primarily focused on the Snipping Tool, then worked through 2024 and most of 2025 on the Paint app, where I helped add exciting AI features like Generative Stickers. Currently, I'm focused on AI features across Windows OS in general while continuing to drive improvements for Inbox apps.

My path to Microsoft wasn't traditional—I started with four years of architectural training at Norwich University and Vermont College, then spent a decade as an architectural draftsman and designer before discovering my passion for programming. For the full story of my journey from blueprints to code, check out my [Career & Education](/career/) page.

My Microsoft journey has taken me through some fascinating teams: I previously worked on APS (Applications, Partners, and Store), where I created OSS toolkits and supported partners ranging from Apple and Spotify to Siemens and IFTTT. Before that, I had a blast on the IoT Maker team building open-source projects for DIY electronics integrated with Microsoft services—including writing the Raspberry Pi NOOBS installer for Windows Preview! I also spent time on the Forefront Online Protection team, securing Office tools like Exchange and Office apps against viruses and data leakage.

It's been an incredibly diverse career that's allowed me to learn far more than a typical development role would offer.

## Beyond the Code

I'm a former daily Jiu-Jitsu practitioner who took an extended break after breaking my ankle in the fourth fight of a competition (against a 300+ lb cop, no less!). I'm hoping to get back on the mats, but between family and work, finding the time is proving to be its own kind of challenge. Mountain biking through the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest has taken the place of exercise of late.

Before becoming a dad, I was an avid motorcyclist who rode far more than I drove. I put about 6,000 miles per year on four wheels and 15,000 on two! I've experienced everything from standards to cruisers to sport bikes, and lastly a sport tourer (ST1300). One of my favorite adventures was a 2,000-mile journey in a single week, riding 400 miles per day through Nova Scotia and around Cape Breton.
