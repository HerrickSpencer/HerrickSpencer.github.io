<div id="msgcns!DB2DE5E67B922610!194" class="bvMsg"><p>First Baseball game in 25yrs!  wow......   They haven't changed much since then... still hitting balls with bats. Kindof sounds like a good funniest home video clip, Bob Saget would make some pithy-yet-stupid joke to  it.</p> <p>Watching Wright drive home the last inning runs to win the game against the A's was quite a thrill.... I might not actually wait a quarter decade to return :)<br />My last game was in Montreal with the Astros vs the A's... so I told my lovely date that if I see another game, it'll have to be with the A's again... </p> <p>Please note the ironic nerd shirt.... </p> <p><a href="http://by1.storage.msn.com/y1pquEz8HoDZDal6yl4u3r50lm2ZqT1GiID3v9N7__YwZcRUMKIFKybsjYWLx2rpRI-gkdZ2PldPxS7HP-arnr3Vw"><img src="http://by1.storage.msn.com/y1pquEz8HoDZDbDB3LftPcdrlTv5noT96Y5NXQqRXvxUrCVc5m13JrXHQbCM4PZEZFt-ERl3srRiV1Du79jcx1wfQ" border="0" /></a></p></div>
