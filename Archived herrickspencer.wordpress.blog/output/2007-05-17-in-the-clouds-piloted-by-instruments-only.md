<div id="msgcns!DB2DE5E67B922610!162" class="bvMsg"><p>[THIS WAS WRITTEN OVER A MONTH AGO]</p> <p>[Happy Month-a-versary D&amp;H!]</p> <p>Why is it that when you first meet someone you get wrapped up in them completely?  Is it a drug like effect?  some sort of bio-chemical blast that overwhelms your senses and sensibilities?   Feels really nice though.... I can't get enough.... but I guess that's the damn point.</p> <p>Its this point in the relationship that you overlook all the negatives that come with that relationship, so that you can see the good the person represents. This seems to give the relationship a chance to blossom into the next phase, and a chance for a future.  Nature is a funny tricky beast that knows how to get you to step out of your own way, and not f' things up too badly that you will have a chance for something good for you.  I like this trick.</p> <p>Started this post about 2 months ago, but it still applies.... I've been thinking much more rationally about my relationship... but still feel that strong pull, and chemical attraction is just as strong as the emotional one.  Even though its natural for this to wane... I hope it lasts forever... or oscillates from strong to medium at the very least.</p></div>
