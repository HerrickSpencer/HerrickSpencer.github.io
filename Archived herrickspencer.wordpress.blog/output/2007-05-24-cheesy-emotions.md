I'm in FULL-BLOWN-CHEESE-HELL.   for those of you that don't know, a food allergy usually causes a symptom similar to manic-depression. It also comes with a slight addiction to that food item.

I'm allergic to milk. Yet, at the start of this week I've had several pieces of pizza, ice-cream etc.  Therefore I was due for a bit of roller-coaster of emotion.

Surprisingly, I hadn't had any, till today.  Now I'm thinking ill of everyone.  Suspicions abound!   Slights such as not being invited to lunch turn into whole complex plots. Indirect questions from managers feel like affronts to ability and standing in the team dynamic.

Yet even still, I remain calm... quiet... externally serene.

Internally, things are a much different situation... body feels tense... organs feel like they are hot and electrified...  my mind is racing with point and counter-point.  I'm constantly arguing with myself as to wether the perceived slight from someone is intended as such or if the feeling of paranoia is simply a product of a Vermont dairy bovine.  Damn cows.... they're cute, but they will mess with your head boy!... Watch out.  Turn your back and it's cud city all over your happy demeanor.
