<div id="msgcns!DB2DE5E67B922610!164" class="bvMsg"><p>So I had a crappy start to my weekend, then it turned into a very nice weekend.</p> <p>Friday night was nice and relaxing.... making tortellini and watching tube on the couch with D, who fell asleep while I rubbed her sore feet. (ahhh, so cute when she's sleeping...)</p> <p>Saturday started horribly (not going to discuss why), and continued to be bad till night time. </p> <p>Sunday (Mother's day) started with a hiccup...  but turned into a very nice day.  Hiking with <a title="Mother's Day" href="http://herrickspencer.spaces.live.com/?_c11_PhotoAlbum_spaHandler=TWljcm9zb2Z0LlNwYWNlcy5XZWIuUGFydHMuUGhvdG9BbGJ1bS5GdWxsTW9kZUNvbnRyb2xsZXI$&amp;_c11_PhotoAlbum_spaFolderID=cns!DB2DE5E67B922610!111&amp;_c11_PhotoAlbum_startingImageIndex=0&amp;_c11_PhotoAlbum_commentsExpand=0&amp;_c11_PhotoAlbum_addCommentExpand=0&amp;_c11_PhotoAlbum_addCommentFocus=0&amp;_c=PhotoAlbum" target="_blank">D&amp;kids</a> then went out to dinner WITH THE WHOLE FAM-DAMN-ILY!!!  Jesus... talk about pressure.  To make matters worse, I'd forgotten to bring a belt along with my nice outfit, and had to go without, looking like I'm too stupid to know how to dress myself.</p> <p>Dinner went well though, and they were all nice and eccentric in different ways...  just the way family should be.</p></div>
