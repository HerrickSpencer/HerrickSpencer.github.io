(sounds painfully reminicent of a herpes symplex outbreak).  However, while listening to my favorite neo-liberal radio station, NPR, I learned of a new breakthrough in transistor radios...  a nanotube radio!

Yes, I know what you are thinking... yaaaaawwn.  but I'm going to tell you about it anyway, you uneducated boob. 

The Nanotube radio is the smallest transciever radio, made from a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">single carbon nanotube!</span> If this doesn't resonate with you (pun intended) then consider that this is less than a micron long and 10 nanometers wide, or 1/10000 the width of a human hair!  A radio! JEEEES!

In this tiny radioactive space (just kidding), is an antenna, tuner, amplifier, and demodulator, everything they needed to dial in the latest in elevator music from any FM channel their hearts desired.  The method of tuning the radio is interesting too... it's totally non-mechanical, involving modulation of an eletrical current through the tube to tune in different frequencies.

Interesting enough, they've also envisioned this radio as a tool for such applications in medicine... think about tiny radios being planted into blood molecules that are injected into your blood stream. These radios could report back from anywhere on the body, allowing complex analysis of different bodily functions, including brain activity.

Further, and a bit scarier, is the possibility of monitoring individuals whereabouts and activities, without them ever knowing. These little buggers are small enough to totally eclipse the use of previous spy tech, making it impossible for us to physically detect them.

So watchout Nokia, the next cell phone I use may be simply implanted directly into my ear lobe!   Hey, my ear is buzzing...   I'd better take this.
